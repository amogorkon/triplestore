# TripleStore
This triplestore strives to provide simple yet powerful arbitrary Subject-Predicate-Object relationship data storage and retrieval purely written in python.

# The Story
First inspired by a master's thesis but completely reworked and refined. Then I got re-inspired by https://tentris.dice-research.org/iswc2020/ but realized that requiring data to be kept in memory is not viable for most people, so I turned it around and asked myself how to realize a triplestore based on hdf5 and sparse matrices.. 


This version is not ready for production.
Please feel free to contribute :)
